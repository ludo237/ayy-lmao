# Epic Film Fact 1

Lightning McQueen, star of the 2006 blockbuster film "Cars" is a statutory rapist. In the film Lightning meets and falls in love with a car named Sally Carrera, a 2002 Porsche 911. This makes Sally only 4 years old during the film (which takes place in 2006). Lightning on the other hand is a stock car and while his age isn't expressly given, we know that an average stock car can race for 20 to 30 years. Because lightning is the best we can assume that he is 30 years old at the end of "Cars 3", which takes place in 2017, 11 years after "Cars". This would make Lightning 19 years old when he meets Sally. As the majority of the films take place in the United States, which has the age of consent set at 17 years old, every time Lightning sticks his engine shaft in Sally's exhaust pipe he is committing statutory rape.
